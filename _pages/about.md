I am Maryam Shaban, a dedicated and enthusiastic electrical engineer with a deep-rooted passion for unraveling the intricacies of electromagnetic fields, microwave technologies, and antenna design. Holding a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, I have embarked on a relentless journey to explore the ever-evolving realm of electrical engineering. My academic pursuits have been driven by an insatiable curiosity to understand and manipulate the fundamental forces that power our modern world.

My journey into the world of electrical engineering has been marked by academic excellence, highlighted by a GPA of 3.28 out of 4, which reflects my commitment to rigorous scholarship and intellectual rigor. My quest for knowledge extends beyond the classroom, as I have actively engaged in cutting-edge research projects. Notably, during my tenure as an Electronic Researcher at the Mechatronic Research Laboratory in the Humanoid Soccer Robot League in Qazvin, Iran, I undertook challenges that demanded both creativity and technical prowess. One of my proudest achievements includes the design of a modified version of the USB2Dynamixel (USB2DXL) board, a task that required me to bridge the gap between TTL and RS-485 Dynamixel series communication. This project not only showcased my problem-solving skills but also heightened my interest in engineering innovation.

Another noteworthy accomplishment in my research journey was the design of compact 2.4 GHz PCB antennas tailored specifically for ESP32 modules. These antennas, which enabled seamless wireless communication and precise remote motor control, embody my dedication to achieving practical, real-world solutions. My experiences in both academic coursework and research have fostered a robust foundation in electrical engineering principles and an unyielding determination to contribute to the field's advancement.

Looking ahead, I am eager to continue my academic and research endeavors at the University of Waterloo, where I believe my aspirations align seamlessly with the institution's commitment to excellence in engineering. Under the guidance of esteemed mentors like Professor Mark Aagaard, I hope to further explore the fascinating domains of electromagnetics, microwave technologies, and antenna design. My goal is to not only expand my own knowledge but also make substantial contributions to the ongoing pursuit of electrical engineering innovation.
